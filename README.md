# analog-and-digital-clock
This project combines the creation of an Analog and Digital Clock using Java Swing. The clock displays both analog and digital representations of the current time, offering a fun and interactive way to visualize time.

## Prerequisites
Ensure that you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

## Usage
### Digital Clock
The digital clock utilizes Java Swing's JPanel for graphical representation.It displays the current time in a bold, red font on a black background.

### Analog Clock
The analog clock is drawn using Java's Graphics and Graphics2D classes.It features hour, minute, and second hands, each represented with different colors.

### Running the Clock
The AnaDigi class initiates the clock, starting a thread for continuous updates.Both the analog and digital representations of the clock are displayed in a JFrame.
